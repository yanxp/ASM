### Citing ASM

If you find ASM useful in your research, please consider citing:

    @article{wang18asm,
        Author = {Keze Wang,Liang Lin, Xiaopeng Yan, Ziliang Chen, Dongyu Zhang, Lei Zhang},
        Title = {{ASM}: Cost-Effective Object Detection: Active Sample Mining with Switchable Selection Criteria},
        Journal = {IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning System(TNNLS)},
        Year = {2018}
    }

### Dependencies 

The code is built on top of R-FCN. Please carefully read through [py-R-FCN](https://github.com/YuwenXiong/py-R-FCN) and make sure py-R-FCN can run within your enviornment.

### Datasets/Pre-trained model

1. In our paper, we used Pascal VOC2007/VOC2012 and COCO as our datasets, and res101.pth model as our pre-trained model.

2. Please download ImageNet-pre-trained res101.pth model manually, and put them into $ASM_ROOT/data/imagenet_models

### Usage

1. training

    Before training, please prepare your dataset and pre-trained model and store them in the right path as R-FCN.You can go to ./tools/ and modify train_net.py to reset some parameters.Then, simply run sh ./train.sh.

2. testing 

    Before testing, you can modify test.sh to choose the trained model path, then simply run sh ./test.sh to get the evaluation result.

### Misc

Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 with a Titan X GPU (12G) and Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2623 v3 @ 3.00GHz.
